Yup, towels or aprons, plural. Because tofu holds so much moisture, the liquid constantly spills over, and we’ve found very few people who just live to clean. To absorb the moisture, and to create much less of a mess, we started using layers of cloth."

Then lay another equal-size baking sheet + covered rack + tofu on top of that. Repeat the same steps as needed. The top layer should be a baking sheet on which you place 30 to 40 pounds of “stuff” to press down on all the layers.

If you look at its abdomen right in the center, you’ll see a longer triangular lip (top of it pointing away from you) that can actually be lifted up. Until you’re comfortable doing it often, you can use the tip of your knife to lift it up, but you’ll want to use your hand to quickly just lift up and fold it over completely.

Gallotannin, one of the main tannins present in sumac, is bitter to taste and dissolves in water easily. Avoid steeping the sumac for too long or its tannins will make the syrup bitter.\nSaffron is ground to a fine powder using a little sugar as an abrasive. Grinding saffron increases the amount of color and flavor extracted than would be achieved if the strands were used directly.\nClub soda if used, adds a second note of acidity from the carbonic acid as well as the crackling sound of bubbles that create a sensation via chemesthesis."

If you need more water—water tends to evaporate—add boiling, not cold, water so as not to stop the steaming."

Rest the plate on the tinfoil, cover, and steam. This method is especially useful when making rice rolls, in which you’ll be using a cake pan instead of the plate."

Or place the tomatoes on wire racks in an oven set as low as it goes and dry for several hours. You could also go old school and place the tomatoes on a wire rack, cover them with cheesecloth, then allow them to air-dry outside on a warm, sunny day or in a sunny window until ready to use.

Put the potatoes into the bottom of the slow cooker and add a small dollop of the miso butter; stir to coat. Season the potatoes lightly with salt. Pat the chicken dry and rub the remaining butter all over the chicken, and especially under the skin of the breasts directly on the breast meat: To do this, gently loosen the skin and separate it from the breast meat by sliding your fingers under the skin, then tuck some butter in there. Set the chicken on top of the potatoes."

You need to weight down the salmon, which you can go about in a couple different ways: A) If you have a dish or container that is slightly smaller than the one the salmon is sitting in, set the smaller container on top of the fish and weight it down with a few cans or a brick; B) Alternatively, fill a large zip-top bag three-quarters full with cold water and seal. Nestle the bag over the piece of fish. If the bag hangs over the sides of the baking dish, pour out some of the water and reseal.

Add the green beans, carrots, and green papaya, bruising lightly with the pestle and mixing with the spoon for about 10 seconds between each addition. Add the lime juice and fish sauce syrup, pound, and mix for another 10 seconds. Add the peanuts and tomatoes and repeat. Everything in the mortar other than the chiles and garlic should be bruised but intact. Don’t overpound.

Fill each one with a dollop of mincemeat. A level tablespoon is probably all you will get into them, unless you have especially deep tins. Be generous.
